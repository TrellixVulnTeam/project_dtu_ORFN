# Project based on YOLACT <3

### What does it do?

1) YOLACT + RealSense cameras
2) YOLACT working on a computer without NVIDIA GPU (running YOLACT on a server) - not impressing actually
3) YOLACT trained on own dataset (tennis balls + boxes)
4) Handling tennis boxes hidden inside boxes

Results: it's hard to recognise a box! (obviously it's just a square :/ )

You can read a """" paper """" [here](https://github.com/ostapana/project_dtu/blob/main/dtu_project.pdf) (not really a paper just a description)
